# Cybersecurity Analysis and Report Generation Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the cybersecurity analysis and report generation process for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in IoT and CCTV systems. The process involves utilizing agents equipped with advanced language models to search and analyze the latest Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) related to IoT and CCTV systems. Subsequently, a detailed report is generated to highlight vulnerabilities and provide actionable advice for improving system security.

## Setup

### Dependencies

- [langchain-community](https://github.com/langchain-community): A community-driven repository for language chain models.
- [crewai](https://github.com/crewai/crewai): A Python library for orchestrating multi-agent workflows.
  
### Installation

```bash
pip install langchain-community crewai
```

### Import Statements

```python
from langchain_community.llms import Ollama
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
```

### Model Loading

```python
mistral = Ollama(model="mistral")
```

## Agents

### Cybersecurity Analyst

- **Role**: Cybersecurity Analyst
- **Goal**: Identify and analyze the latest CVEs related to IoT and CCTV systems.
- **Backstory**: As a cybersecurity analyst with extensive experience in system vulnerabilities and risk assessment, you are tasked with analyzing system configurations and CVE details to identify potential compromises. Your expertise lies in dissecting CVE reports, understanding their implications on IoT and CCTV systems, and devising strategic advice for mitigating risks.
- **Tools**: Equipped with advanced language models for analysis.
- **Verbosity**: Enabled for detailed logging.
- **Delegation**: Allowed for task distribution.

### Report Generator

- **Role**: Report Generator
- **Goal**: Generate a comprehensive report based on the CVE analysis with advice for IoT system security improvement.
- **Backstory**: With a deep understanding of cybersecurity practices and the ability to translate technical findings into actionable advice, you specialize in creating detailed reports. These reports not only highlight vulnerabilities but also provide step-by-step guidance on enhancing security postures for IoT and CCTV systems.
- **Tools**: Equipped with advanced language models for report generation.
- **Verbosity**: Enabled for detailed logging.
- **Delegation**: Allowed for task distribution.

## Tasks

### Task: Search and Analyze CVEs

- **Description**: Scrape web for searching the latest IoT and CCTV CVEs. Analyze these CVEs to identify the type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflow), the components of the system likely affected, and assess the impact level (high, medium, low) on the system.
- **Expected Output**: A summary of identified vulnerabilities, including types, affected components, and impact levels.
- **Assigned Agent**: Cybersecurity Analyst

### Task: Report Generation

- **Description**: Using the analysis from the previous task, generate a comprehensive report detailing the identified vulnerabilities, affected components, and provide advice for IoT system security improvements. Include good security practices and recommendations for mitigating identified vulnerabilities.
- **Expected Output**: A detailed report with vulnerabilities, security advice, and mitigation strategies.
- **Assigned Agent**: Report Generator

## Crew Setup

```python
cve_crew = Crew(
    agents=[cve_analyst, report_generator],
    tasks=[task_search_analyze, task_report_generation],
    verbose=2,
    process=Process.sequential,
)
```

## Execution

```python
result = cve_crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```
