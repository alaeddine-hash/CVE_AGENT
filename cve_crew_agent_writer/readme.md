## CrewAI CVE Analysis and Report Generation Documentation

### Introduction

This document provides an overview and documentation for the CrewAI setup used for cybersecurity analysis, CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identification, and report generation related to IoT (Internet of Things) and CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) systems.

### Components

#### 1. CrewAI Setup

- **Import Statements:**
  - `Ollama` from `langchain_community.llms`
  - `Agent`, `Task`, `Crew`, `Process` from `crewai`

- **CrewAI Tools:**
  - `DirectoryReadTool`, `FileReadTool`, `SerperDevTool`, `WebsiteSearchTool` from `crewai_tools`

#### 2. API Keys

The `SERPER_API_KEY` environment variable is set with the API key for accessing the Serper.dev API.

#### 3. Local Model Loading

The Ollama model named "mistral" is loaded for natural language processing tasks.

#### 4. Agents

- **Cybersecurity Analyst Agent:**
  - Role: Cybersecurity Analyst
  - Goal: Identify and analyze the latest CVEs related to IoT and CCTV systems
  - Backstory: Detailed backstory provided in the code documentation
  - Tools: SearchTool and WebRagTool
  - Delegation: Allowed
  - Language Model: Ollama

- **Report Generator Agent:**
  - Role: Report Generator
  - Goal: Generate a comprehensive report based on the CVE analysis with advice for IoT system security improvement
  - Backstory: Detailed backstory provided in the code documentation
  - Tools: SearchTool and WebRagTool
  - Delegation: Allowed
  - Language Model: Ollama

- **Content Writer Agent:**
  - Role: Content Writer
  - Goal: Craft engaging blog posts about the AI industry
  - Backstory: Detailed backstory provided in the code documentation
  - Tools: DirectoryReadTool and FileReadTool
  - Delegation: Allowed
  - Language Model: Ollama

#### 5. Tasks

- **Search and Analyze CVEs Task:**
  - Description: Scrape the web for searching the latest IoT and CCTV CVEs. Analyze these CVEs to identify the type of vulnerability, affected components, and impact level on the system.
  - Expected Output: A summary of identified vulnerabilities, including types, affected components, and impact levels.
  - Agent: Cybersecurity Analyst

- **Generate Comprehensive Report Task:**
  - Description: Generate a comprehensive report detailing identified vulnerabilities, affected components, and provide advice for IoT system security improvements.
  - Expected Output: A detailed report with vulnerabilities, security advice, and mitigation strategies.
  - Agent: Report Generator

- **Write Blog Post Task:**
  - Description: Write an engaging blog post about the AI industry, based on the research analystâ€™s summary. Draw inspiration from the latest blog posts in the directory.
  - Expected Output: A 4-paragraph blog post formatted in markdown with engaging, informative, and accessible content, avoiding complex jargon.
  - Agent: Content Writer

#### 6. Crew Setup

- **Agents:** All agents (Cybersecurity Analyst, Report Generator, Content Writer) are added to the Crew.
- **Tasks:** All tasks (Search and Analyze CVEs, Generate Comprehensive Report, Write Blog Post) are added to the Crew.
- **Verbose:** Verbose mode is enabled for detailed logging.
- **Process:** The process is set to sequential execution.

### Execution

The Crew is initiated with the defined agents and tasks, and the process is kicked off. The output is stored in the `result` variable, and it contains the outcome of the Crew execution.

### Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the CrewAI setup for cybersecurity analysis, CVE identification, and report generation. It details the components, agents, tasks, and execution process involved in the setup.
